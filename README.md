## About the Add-on

With this Gmail add-on, you can create a sets of bulletproof buttons in your mails. These buttons has a mailto link back to the sender with button-specific answer. 

A usage for example:

You have to ask a group of people about something and you want from everyone a quick reply mail with 'Ok', 'Got it', 'Can't make' etc. answers. Create buttons some of these answers and send to them in the mail. They just have to click on one of them, then send the premade mail back to you. So simple :)

You can reach the add-on
- on web the draft panel bottom line/tray next to the send button and the basic features button wiht a Re: logo
- on mobile the top right menu's last element

### Options:
- __reply address__: Where the buttons' mailto link will point
- __subject__: The reply mails subject, without "Re:" prefix, usually same as your mail subject
- __button texts__: You can create 1 or more buttons, if you seperate the button text with comma. Whitespace allowed, but trimmed. To use comma, write semicolon and it will be changed
- __text color__: by defualt Google blue (##4885ed) (with hex code of colors - [pick some here](http://www.color-hex.com/))
- __fill color__: by default white  (with hex codes)
- __border color__: by default same as text color (with hex code)
- __border rounded__: number between 1 and 10, default is 5 (the Smart Reply buttons has probably 4 or 5 in this metric)

Save your settings automatically.
