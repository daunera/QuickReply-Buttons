# QuickReply-Buttons
A Gmail Add-on, which brings the Android Gmail app 'Smart Reply' buttons functionality to you. You can create your own buttons with unique look. In browsers or on mobile.

[About Smart Reply](https://blog.google/products/gmail/save-time-with-smart-reply-in-gmail/)

## About the Add-on

### Options:
- __reply address__ (with some suggestions based on your mail address)
- __subject__: You have to set this before create the buttons, because the reply mail has the "Re: [subject]" format.
- __button texts__: You can create 1 or more buttons, if you seperate the button text with comma.
- __text and border color__ (with hex code of colors - [pick some here](http://www.color-hex.com/))
- __fill color__ (with hex codes)
- __border rounded__: default is 5 (the Smart Reply buttons has probably 4 or 5 in this metric)

You can save in the add-on your setting with the 'Remember the sets' checkbox.

## Install ([from here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/add-ons/how-tos/install-unpublished))

You can install a developer add-on's deployment with the following steps:

1. [Open the Gmail add-on settings tab.](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/addons)
2. In the __Add-ons__ tab, make sure that you have selected the __Enable developer add-ons for my account__ checkbox.
3. Paste your add-on's deployment ID into the __Install developer add-on__ textbox and click __Install__.
4. Optionally, check the __Enable debugging information__ checkbox. If selected, any errors the add-on script encounters cause the add-on to automatically display an error card to the user.

Once installed, the add-on is immediately available in Gmail. You may need to refresh the Gmail tab before the add-on appears.
